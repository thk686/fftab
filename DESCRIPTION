Title: Tidy manipulation of fourier transformed data

Description: Provides functions for storing fourier coefficients in a tibble and
  manipulating them in various ways. The main different between tidy_fft and base
  R is that tidy_fft computes the normalized fourier frequencies in cycles per stride,
  i.e., cycles per interval between samples, which is often a point of confusion for
  new users and convenient for plotting, etc. Because the frequencies and coefficients
  are stored in a tibble (data.frame), easy processing with, e.g., dplyr is facilitated.
