Title: Tidy Manipulation of Fourier Transformed Data

Description: The 'fftab' package stores Fourier coefficients in a tibble and 
  allows their manipulation in various ways. Functions are available for converting 
  between complex, rectangular ('re', 'im'), and polar ('mod', 'arg') representations, 
  as well as for extracting components as vectors or matrices. Inputs can include 
  vectors, time series, and arrays of arbitrary dimensions, which are restored 
  to their original form when inverting the transform. Since 'fftab' stores Fourier 
  frequencies as columns in the tibble, many standard operations on spectral data 
  can be easily performed using tidy packages like 'dplyr'.
