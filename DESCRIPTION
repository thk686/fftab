Title: Tidy Manipulation of Fourier Transformed Data
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: 
    person("Timothy", "Keitt", , "tkeitt@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides functions for storing fourier coefficients in a tibble and
  manipulating them in various ways. Functions are provided for changing between
  complex, rectangular (re, im), and polar (mod, arg) representations are
  provided, as well as functions for extracting components as vectors or
  matrices. Inputs can be vectors, time series, and arrays of arbitrary
  dimension, and these are restored to their original form when inverting
  the transform. Because fftab stores the fourier frequencies as columns
  in the tibble, many standard operations on spectral data can be easily
  computed using tidy packages, including dplyr.
