\title{Calculate Scaled Cross-Spectrum Between Two Time Series}
\usage{
scaled_cross_spec(a, b)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{A numeric vector representing the first time series.}

\item{b}{A numeric vector representing the second time series.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{dim_1}: Frequency bins or dimensions from the spectral analysis.
\item \code{mod}: The normalized coherence values for each frequency bin.
}
}
\description{
Computes the scaled cross-spectrum between two time series, quantifying the degree of linear relationship
between them at different frequencies using their cross-spectrum.
}
\details{
The scaled cross-spectrum is a normalized measure of the cross-spectral density between two signals.
It indicates how well the signals align at specific frequencies, with values ranging
between 0 (no coherence) and 1 (perfect coherence). The coherence is calculated as:

\deqn{C_{ab}(f) = \frac{|S_{ab}(f)|}{\sqrt{S_{aa}(f) \cdot S_{bb}(f)}}}

Where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{S_{ab}(f)}: Cross-spectral density of signals \eqn{a} and \eqn{b}.
\item \eqn{S_{aa}(f)}: Power spectral density of signal \eqn{a}.
\item \eqn{S_{bb}(f)}: Power spectral density of signal \eqn{b}.
}

The dominant frequency (maximum magnitude) is used for normalization.
