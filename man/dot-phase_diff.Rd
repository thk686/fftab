\title{Compute Phase Difference Between Two Signals}
\usage{
.phase_diff(a, b)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{A \code{tidy_fft} object or signal representing the first input.}

\item{b}{A \code{tidy_fft} object or signal representing the second input.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the \strong{phase difference} (in radians) between the two signals.
}
\description{
Computes the phase difference between two signals based on their cross-spectrum.
}
\details{
This function computes the \strong{cross-spectrum} of two signals, converts it into polar representation,
weights the phase angles by their magnitudes, and calculates the weighted average phase difference.

This approach emphasizes phase contributions from higher magnitude components.
